# Weatherhaven USA public-site redesign

This folder is a separate copy of `weatherhaven-special-forces-may` with the public site redesigned. The original folder, the GitHub repo, Vercel and Supabase were not touched. This copy has no git remote on purpose, so nothing here can be pushed by accident.

## Run it

The download carries the code and the new media only. The existing photos (about 390 MB) are copied from your original project by a one-time script, which only reads the original:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/weatherhaven-usa-redesign     # wherever you unzipped it
bash finish-setup.sh                          # copies public/ media from ~/weatherhaven-special-forces-may, runs npm install
npm run dev                                   # http://localhost:3000
```

If the original lives somewhere else, pass its path: `bash finish-setup.sh ~/path/to/weatherhaven-special-forces-may`.

Without a `.env.local`, the site runs on the built-in content (verified specs, news, deployments). Forms and sign-in won't submit, which is the safe default for a demo. If you want live CMS data, copy `.env.local` over from the original folder, but then the contact form and mission builder would write to the real database and send real notification emails.

To share it, deploy it as a **new** Vercel project (`npx vercel`), not the production one.

## What changed

- **Look:** dark defense-tech theme with Weatherhaven orange as the accent. One typeface (Archivo, with wide headlines), chamfered buttons, riveted "data plate" panels.
- **Homepage:**
  - Film hero.
  - Verified numbers.
  - A scroll-driven technical drawing of a MECC going from 160 ft² on the truck to 420 ft² on the ground.
  - The four shelter families.
  - A dot-matrix world map of the 155 documented deployments, with filters.
  - The factory film, a 1981–2026 timeline, the latest news and a contact band.
- **Systems** (`/configurable-solutions`): a catalog filtered by family, mission, environment and transport. All 17 product pages have published specs taken from Weatherhaven literature (ISO containers and Series 1.5 & 2 say "specifications on request" because nothing is published for them).
- **Capabilities, contact, events, news, resources, mission builder, privacy, terms and 404:** rebuilt in the same system, with the copy rewritten in plain language.
- **News:** 12 real releases with direct links (Supacat, Battlefield 2027, Land Forces, DVD, MSPO and others), merged with anything in the CMS.
- **Untouched:** the SOF portal and admin keep their original design and behavior.

## Bringing it into the real repo

The redesign is also provided as `redesign.patch`, a diff against commit `e0f53c3` of the original repo:

```bash
git checkout -b redesign
git apply redesign.patch
```

Then copy the new media from this folder's `public/` into the repo and commit it. The patch can't include these files because they are binary:

- `public/weatherhaven-logo-reverse.png` and `public/weatherhaven-logo-reverse@2x.png`
- `public/hero/hero-poster.jpg`, `deploy-poster.jpg` and `built-poster.jpg`
- `public/hero/hero-1080.mp4`, `hero-720.mp4`, `built-720.mp4` and `deploy-720.mp4`

## Things to check before this goes live

1. **Product photos.** RDMSS, Airmax HP and Series 1.5 & 2 have no product photos of their own, so their pages use a representative Weatherhaven photo.
2. **Product status.** Confirm Series 1.5 & 2 and HERCon are still sold.
3. **Country count.** The site says 95+ countries; some Weatherhaven pages say 90+.
4. **Airmax LP PDF.** Confirm the info sheet is cleared for public download.
5. **CMS content.**
   - CMS product rows that still hold the old placeholder specs are upgraded on the fly to the verified content.
   - Running the catalog sync script would store that content in the database for good.
   - The 12 verified news items are built in. Once they are in the CMS, the built-in list can be deleted.
6. **"48 hours" response time.** This promise is carried over from the old site. Make sure the team can meet it.
7. **Legacy redirect.** The old `/hqss` link still redirects to EHMECC, but public sources describe HQSS as RDMSS-based.
8. **Mission builder.** The camp planner logic was left as it was, and it still puts Endurance in the "Power yard" and labels ATEPS "Camp power and infrastructure". It is shared with the SOF planner, so it needs a deliberate fix.
9. **Shared product data.** Corrected mission types and transport modes in `weatherhaven-product-lines.ts` also feed the SOF planner's recommendations.
